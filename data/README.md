# Data Files
This directory contains data files pulled from the [CCMC database of the dB/dt challenge results](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/challenges/dBdt/timeseries.php).
Unnecessary directories have been removed:
CMIT runs
SWMF_9a run
5_WEIMER results (erroneous results).

Data was obtained in 2013 but has been static on the website since that date.

Notes from original README (via CCMC):
Information as of August 30, 2013
prepared by Lutz Rastaetter, CCMC

Runs involved in the study:

2_LFM-MIX (2_CMIT is a newer model version found to perform more as expected by the modeler)
4_OPENGGCM
9_SWMF
2-WEIGEL
6_WEIMER (5_WEIMER were incorrect)

Overview images:

PNG images in each Event directory were prepared by Dan Weimer.
An image was prepared for each model run from the data on this FTP server.

The images show the observed and modeled Delta-B components (North, East, Down) 
for the 12 magnetometer stations that were selected in the GEM 2008 study.
